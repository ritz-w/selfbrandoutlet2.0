## Self Brand Outlet
Self Brand Outlet is a simple demo e-commerce application built with React on the frontend, and Node.JS, Mongoose, and Express on the backend. It is a single page application rendering React from the server. It features essential e-commerce functionality such as different views showcasing objects, search functionality, 
as well as a shopping cart and checkout.

As an online shop, it also serves as a exhibition of objects that artists have created as ordinary commodities to be bought and sold. The shop itself is a document of various ways artists have approached the idea of commerce in their practices. 

## Background
While I have been thinking of the idea for using an online shop as an exhibition of commodities as artworks for a while, a large part of what motivated this project was technical experimentation.

For the structure of the app, I decided on using the MERN stack, as it increases in popularity and is driving the development of modern web applications.

Having practiced working with Node and Express on the backend, this project was built with the outcome in mind of creating a fully functioning demo site through which I could see how the MERN stack worked in production. I also had wanted to experiment with different ideas and libraries, one of which was to implement a functioning payment system through Stripe. 

This project was also a way to challenge myself in terms of web design. Taking inspiration from Japanese graphic designers and their use of typography, particularly [Yoshihisa Shirai](http://www.dnp.co.jp/CGI/gallery/schedule/detail.cgi?l=2&t=1&seq=00000709), I wanted to see if I could think of more interesting ways to structure the page than the standard Bootstrap look. I sketched the application out on paper first, to get a different approach to spacing and structuring each box element.
